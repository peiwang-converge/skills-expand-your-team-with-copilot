# Teacher's Guide: Using Issue Templates for Change Requests

Welcome! This guide will help you request changes, bug fixes, and improvements to the school activities system without needing to modify code directly.

## How It Works

When you create a new issue in GitHub, you'll see several template options designed specifically for teachers. Each template guides you through providing the right information so our automated Copilot coding agent can understand and implement your request without needing to ask follow-up questions.

## Available Issue Templates

### üöÄ Feature Enhancement Request
**Use this when you want to add new functionality to the system**

Examples:
- Adding a filter to sort activities by difficulty level
- Creating a way to export student participation lists
- Adding email notifications for activity sign-ups

This template will ask you to:
- Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- Explain your proposed solution
- List specific requirements (acceptance criteria)
- Identify who would benefit from this feature

### üêõ Bug Report
**Use this when something isn't working correctly**

Examples:
- Students can't sign up for activities
- The website doesn't load on mobile phones
- Activity information displays incorrectly

This template will ask you to:
- Describe what's happening vs. what should happen
- Provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem
- Identify which browsers/devices are affected
- Explain how this impacts teaching and learning

### üìö Documentation Update
**Use this when guides, instructions, or help materials need improvement**

Examples:
- Adding missing instructions for teachers
- Updating outdated screenshots in user guides
- Creating FAQ for common student questions

This template will ask you to:
- Identify what documentation needs updating
- Describe what's missing or incorrect
- Specify who the documentation is for
- Define what successful documentation looks like

### üé® UI/UX Improvement
**Use this when the interface or user experience needs improvement**

Examples:
- Making buttons larger for easier mobile use
- Changing colors to match school branding
- Improving how students see which activities they're enrolled in

This template will ask you to:
- Describe the current user experience problem
- Explain your vision for improvement
- Consider accessibility needs
- Specify device priorities (mobile vs. desktop)

### üí° General Request
**Use this for requests that don't fit the other categories**

Examples:
- Setting up automated data backups
- Configuring security settings
- Administrative system changes

## Tips for Writing Effective Requests

### 1. Be Specific and Clear
Instead of: "The website needs to be better"
Write: "Students have difficulty finding activities that match their skill level because all activities are displayed together without filtering options"

### 2. Provide Context
Explain not just WHAT you want, but WHY you need it:
- How many students/teachers are affected?
- What problems does this solve?
- How does this improve teaching or learning?

### 3. Include Examples
Use real scenarios from your classroom:
- "When Maria tried to sign up for Drama Club, she got confused because she couldn't tell if she was already enrolled"
- "During lunch periods, 200+ students access the system on their phones, but the buttons are too small to tap accurately"

### 4. Think About Success
What would tell you the issue is completely resolved?
- Students can successfully sign up without confusion
- Teachers can export participation lists in under 30 seconds
- All text is readable on both phone and computer screens

### 5. Consider All Users
Think about how changes might affect:
- Students with different technical skills
- Teachers who are less comfortable with technology
- Students with disabilities (vision, motor skills, etc.)
- Users on different devices (phones, tablets, computers)

## What Happens After You Submit

1. **Automatic Processing**: Our Copilot coding agent will review your request
2. **Implementation**: If the request is clear and complete, the agent will implement the changes
3. **Updates**: You'll receive notifications about progress on your issue
4. **Testing**: Once complete, you can test the changes and provide feedback

## Need Help?

If you're unsure which template to use or need help writing your request:

1. **Start with any template** - The questions will guide you to the right information
2. **Ask questions** - Use the "üí¨ Ask a Question" link to get help from the community
3. **Check documentation** - Review existing guides to see if your question is already answered

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too vague**: "Make it better" doesn't give enough information
- **Too technical**: You don't need to suggest specific code changes
- **Missing context**: Always explain WHY you need the change
- **Forgetting mobile users**: Many students primarily use phones
- **Not considering accessibility**: Some students may have vision or motor disabilities

## Examples of Well-Written Requests

### Good Feature Request
"Students are confused about which activities they've already signed up for because there's no visual indication on the activities page. They often try to sign up for the same activity multiple times. I need a way for students to quickly see their enrollment status - maybe with a checkmark or different background color for enrolled activities."

### Good Bug Report
"When students click 'Sign Up' for any activity, they see a loading spinner that never goes away. After waiting 5+ minutes, nothing happens and they're not enrolled. This happens on Chrome and Safari browsers on both phones and computers. About 50 students have reported this issue this week, preventing them from joining activities."

Remember: The goal is to provide enough clear information that an automated system can understand and fix your request without needing to ask follow-up questions. These templates are designed to guide you through providing exactly what's needed!
